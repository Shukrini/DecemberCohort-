        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li> 1/2 unsalted butter</li>
            <li> 2 1/2 pounds apple, peeled and cored</li>
            <li> 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li> 1 pie dough </li>
            <li> 1 egg </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Preparation</h2>
        <ol> 
            <li>Melt butter in a large saute pan set over medium-high heat and add apples to the pan. <br> Stir to coat fruit with butter and cook, stirring occasionally. <br> Meanwhile, whisk together the spices, salt and 1 tablespoon sugar, and sprinkle this over the pan, stirring to combine. <br> Lower heat and cook until apples have started to soften, approximately 5 to 7 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Place a large baking sheet on the middle rack of oven and preheat to 425. <br> Remove one disc of dough from the refrigerator and, using a pin, roll it out on a lightly floured surface until it is roughly 12 inches in diameter.<br> Fit this crust into a 9-inch pie plate, trimming it to leave a .5-inch overhang.<br> Place this plate, with the dough, in the freezer.</li>
            <li> Roll out the remaining dough on a lightly floured surface <br> until it is roughly 10 or 11 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li> Remove pie crust from freezer and put the cooled pie filling into it. Cover with remaining dough. <br> Press the edges together, trim the excess, then crimp the edges with the tines of a fork. <br> Using a sharp knife, cut three or four steam vents in the top of the crust. <br>Lightly brush the top of the pie with egg wash and sprinkle with remaining tablespoon of sugar.</li>
            <li> Place pie in oven and bake on hot baking sheet for 20 minutes, then reduce temperature to 375.<br> Continue to cook until the interior is bubbling <br> and the crust is golden brown, about 30 to 40 minutes more. </li>

        </ol>
